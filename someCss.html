		<p id="paragraph1">Hello! My name is Nonthakit Chaiwong, Thai people who come and study in University of Washington. Nice to meet you! My experience so far here is very fun. There's a lot of opportunity to do in UW. I'm actuary very introvert person, so I don't like anything like party or loud places. However, I love to do activity that I can do alone or with small group of people. Right now I have a lot of hobby: boardgames, video games, violin, piano, website development, programming competition, and rock climbing. I used to think that I don't like sport, but recently I realize that I only hate sport that's compete with other people. Among those hobbies, violin, programming competition and rock climbing are what I tried to be expert at. I have a notion the best people is someone who knows many things, but experts in at least one thing. That's why I thrive for more knowledge so I can decide what I want to be expert at.</p>
		<p id="paragraph2">Among every knowledge, programming is the skill that I am the most expert at. I used to compete both in national and international competition. I'm actuary used to compete in science and mathematics competitions too when I was younger, but I decide to focus on programming once I entered high school. The reason I am good at these thing is because I understand logic. One of my amazing skills, which is what my friends praise a lot, is the skill to interpret new code which is completely new to everyone, and integrate with my work. That's why in my web development team, my teammate would ask me to work as a middle-man, who work on connecting all codes together, and also frequently ask me to help them with new api. To do that I have to be able to understand their codes which usually in different programming language: SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript. Since I'm expert at computer logic, I am able to work which much quicker pace that my other teammates. (In another word, they just ask me to do the work that will take time to understand, so the projects will be finished quicker.)</p><br><br>
